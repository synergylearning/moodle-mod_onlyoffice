OnlyOffice activity module for Moodle.

Once configured to work with a specific OnlyOffice server, an activity instance can be created in a Moodle course. Students on that course can then work together on documents, using the OnlyOffice interface.

Note: files composer.json and composer.lock are included to make it easier for future upgrades of this plugin to update to later versions of the firebase/php-jwt library.

If doing such an update, the new plugin version should be tested and committed to the code repository. Composer should not be used to by site admins for any such updates.
